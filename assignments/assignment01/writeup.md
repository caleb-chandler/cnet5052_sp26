4a/b. I came up with a distance measure designed for a specific scenario where you have two graphs and you want to see the extent to which the "importance" distributions are the same.
The descriptor takes a graph G and returns an ensemble of CDFs from four centrality measures: harmonic, betweenness, eigenvector, and degree. Distance is then calculated as the average of the JS divergence between each pair of CDFs. Harmonic centrality is used in place of closeness to make the descriptor robust to disconnected graphs. Wasserstein distance is chosen because it directly compares probability distributions.
I think this is a good descriptor for the stated goal because it accounts for each of the main four centrality metrics for a more holistic and "complete" output.
